0.99

- The much-request "arbitrary attributes" feature has been added.
Thanks to Jon Swartz for the patch.  You can now do this:

  use Exception::Class ( 'My::Exception' => { fields => [ 'bar', 'baz' ] } );

  ...

  if ( UNIVERSAL::isa( $@, 'My::Exception' ) { print $@->bar, $@->baz; }

0.98

- Subclasses that overrode the ->as_string method had to repeat the
stringification overloading for exception objects.  This has been
changed so that the stringification overloading is now

  sub { $_[0]->as_string }

Suggested by Jon Swartz.

0.97

- Incorporated a patch from Ken Williams that works around several
Perl 5.6.0 bugs.

- Test 31 was explicitly different for 5.6.0.  Ken said that the
difference actually made it fail (whereas in the past for me it
succeeded).  Tweak this test a bit more to just be more flexible under
5.6.0.

0.96

- Changes wasn't in MANIFEST.  Oops.

- Doc tweaks and cleanup of README.

- Make do_trace a synonym to Trace for backwards compatibility.

0.95

** INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES IN THIS RELEASE **

- Remove do_trace method and replace it with Trace method, which is
inherited by subclasses.

- Exception object now always have a Devel::StackTrace object
available.  The Trace method only determines whether or not it is
included when the exception is stringified.

- A new parameter show_trace for throw which allows you to override
the value of Trace on a case by case basis.

- Fix uninit value warning with 5.00503.


0.90

- fix buglet reported by Terrence Brannon that could occur while
trying to figure out where the exception was thrown, if the exception
was thrown from the package that the exception is an object of.

- doc improvements suggested Nathaniel Smith (related to using
Error.pm) and Mark Stosberg.

0.85

- added ability to use message instead of error as hash key to
constructor.

0.8

- changed object from psuedo-hash to regular hash

- added package, file, & line methods to exception object.

- added more tests for exception object accessors

0.7

- hack in test.pl to allow tests to pass under 5.6.0.

- README details various Perl bugs this module (along with
Devel::StackTrace) can expose and some possible workarounds.
